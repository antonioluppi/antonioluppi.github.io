# What I am doing now

My routine and commitments.

## Work

Currently I work full time for Trenz Electronic, mostly with hardware test automation and hardware design. This job is where I've been putting most of my energy, into developing and achieving great things, while learning from great engineers.

## Learning 

So because I moved to Germany this year, my main goal besides working is to learn German. This is where I invest most of my free time. I am looking to achieve a German A1 until the end of the 2018 and finish B1 until the end of next year. 

## Leisure and Recreation

Getting back to a fit life: gym at least 3 times a week, bouldering once a week and a casual squash. When I get more adapted to this routine, I plan to introduce some gymnastics elements to my workout, e.g.: handstands and l-sits to begin with.
